# Variable_Block_Size_Image_Compression_using_Graphs

the gsp_env.yml file contanins the anaconda environment required for execution of this project.

The code follows paper:
Kahu, Samruddhi Y., and Kishor M. Bhurchandi. "JPEG-based Variable Block-Size Image Compression using CIE La* b* Color Space." KSII Transactions on Internet & Information Systems 12, no. 10 (2018).

Instead of the DCT as a transform, Graph-based Fourier Transform (GFT) is used in the algorithm described in the above paper. 
Main code is contained in Variable_BlockSize_Analysis_GFT.py
